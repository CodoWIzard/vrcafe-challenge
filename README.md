## What part makes me the happiest?

**Making my own custom hook**
I haven't been making custom hooks or hooks in general much, so figuring this out feels like an extra step towards getting to know React better.
It looks a little weird in my opnion, but I'm happy to say that this figures out most of the logic for my categories and tasks.
What you see underneath here is basically TypeScript.. typescripting. Many types that check each other to either add, update or delete a category or task. As well as a toggle for finishing a task.
